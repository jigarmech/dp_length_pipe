Pipe Diameter Calculation Tool

This Python script calculates the optimal pipe diameter for a given set of pipes in a fluid flow system. It uses the Darcy-Weisbach equation to estimate the pressure drop across each pipe and iteratively adjusts the pipe diameters until convergence is achieved.

Problem Statement

You have a system with 5 pipes, each with a different length. The fluid velocity, density, and friction factor are known. Your goal is to find the optimal pipe diameter for each pipe to minimize the pressure drop while maintaining a specified tolerance.

How It Works

Input: The user provides the length of each pipe (in meters).
Initialization: The initial pipe diameter is set to 1 mm (0.001 m) for all pipes.
Iteration:
Calculate the pressure drop for each pipe using the current diameters.
Compute the average pressure drop across all pipes.
Update the diameters based on the average pressure drop.
Check for convergence (i.e., whether the pressure drops have stabilized within the specified tolerance).
Output: The final pipe diameters for each pipe are displayed.
Usage

Run the Python script.
Enter the length of each pipe when prompted.
Observe the convergence process and the final pipe diameters.
